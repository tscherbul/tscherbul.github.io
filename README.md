# Tscherbul Group Website

This is the website of our theoretical research group at the University of Nevada, Reno.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. It is modeled after the website of the [Allan Lab](http://www.allanlab.org/) at Leiden University, who designed the website to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).

Go to *aboutwebsite.md*  to learn how to copy and modify this page as you see fit.
