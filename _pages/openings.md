# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will join the group of theorists who are pushing the frontiers of quantum physics of atoms and molecules by  designing novel tools to control their quantum dynamics using external electromagentic fields.  You will be exploring fundamental questions related to chemical reactivity at ultralow temperatures, quantum coherence, and quantum theory of open systems. You will be developing algorithms for solving computationally hard quantum problems, and your discoveries will stimulate novel experiments exploring the fascinating world of quantum physics. 

### Current open positions

You find the current job openings here:
[Opening 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/GeneralPostdoc_2019_v01.pdf),
[Opening 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PPMS_PhD_2019_v01.pdf).

It might be interesting to look at some past job advertisements. While the projects keep changing, the themes are still roughly the same. You can download them [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PD.pdf), [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PHD1.pdf), or [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PHD2.pdf).

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

There are  postdoc scholarship available.  I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/nwo/innovational-research-incentives-scheme/veni/index.html) or the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm).

### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
