# Open positions

We are always looking for talented and passionate Master students, Graduate students, and Postdocs to join our team! 

You will join the group of theorists who are pushing the frontiers of quantum physics of atoms and molecules by  designing novel tools to control their quantum dynamics using external electromagentic fields.  You will be exploring fundamental questions related to chemical reactivity at ultralow temperatures, quantum coherence, and quantum theory of open systems. You will be developing algorithms for solving computationally hard quantum problems, and your discoveries will stimulate novel experiments exploring the fascinating world of quantum physics. 

### PhD and Postdoc applications
If you are interested in working in our group either as a PhD student or a postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:ttscherbul@unr.edu). State why you are interested in the group's research and attach your CV, including information about the grades. If you are applying to a specific job advertisement, make sure to mention this in your email.

There are  postdoc scholarship available.  I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/nwo/innovational-research-incentives-scheme/veni/index.html) or the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm).

### Master projects for UNR students
If you are a Master student at UNR looking for an interesting quantum physics project, email me (mailto:ttscherbul@unr.edu).
