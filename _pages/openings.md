# Open positions

We are always looking for talented and passionate Master students, Graduate students, and Postdocs to join our team! 

You will join the group of theorists who are pushing the frontiers of quantum physics of atoms and molecules by  designing novel tools to control their quantum dynamics using external electromagentic fields.  You will be exploring fundamental questions related to chemical reactivity at ultralow temperatures, quantum coherence, and quantum theory of open systems. You will be developing algorithms for solving computationally hard quantum problems, and your discoveries will stimulate novel experiments exploring the fascinating world of quantum physics. 

### PhD and Postdoc applications
If you are interested in working in our group either as a PhD student or a postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:ttscherbul@unr.edu) saying why you are interested in the group's research and attach your CV, including information about your grades. If you are applying to a specific job advertisement, make sure to mention this in your email.

For a list of graduate scholarships and awards available at UNR, go to the [graduate school webpage](https://www.unr.edu/grad/admissions/funding/awards). I would be happy to support you as a Graduate Research Assistant after you apply to our group. 

### Master projects for UNR students
