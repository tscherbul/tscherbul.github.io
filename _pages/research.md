# Research

We explore the fascinating world of quantum dynamics of complex atomic and molecular systems using the tools and techniques of quantum mechanics. The ultimate goal of our research is to understand and control molecular collisions and chemical reactions at the most fundamental quantum level. To make it possible, we explore these processes theoretically by solving the Schrodinger equations for molecules colliding in the presence of external electromagnetic fields.  We are also interested in how quantum dynamics in complex molecular systems are affected by an external environment, which causes relation and decoherence of quantum superposition states.

We also develop new theoretical methods and computer codes for accurate quantum dynamical calculations of complex quantum systems and processes, such as chemical reactions at ultralow temperatures in the presence of external fields.
