# Research

We explore the fascinating world of quantum dynamics of complex atomic and molecular systems using the tools and techniques of quantum mechanics. The ultimate goal of our research is to understand and control complex quantum phenomena at the most fundamental level. To make it possible, we explore these phenomena theoretically by developing novel algorithms for solving the fundamental equation of quantum physics - the Schrodinger equation - for atomic and molecular systems of ever increasing complexity. We are also interested in how quantum dynamics in these systems are affected by an external environment, which causes relaxation and decoherence of quantum superposition states.

We also develop new theoretical methods and computer codes for accurate and efficient quantum dynamical calculations of complex quantum systems and processes, such as chemical reactions at ultralow temperatures in the presence of external electromagnetic fields.
