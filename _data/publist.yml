- title: "Complete Quantum Coherent Control of Ultracold Molecular Collisions"
  image: 2021-CC-PRL.png
  description: We show that quantum interference-based coherent control is a highly efficient tool for tuning ultracold molecular collision dynamics. The basic idea of coherent control is to prepare tunable quantum superposition states ("Schrodinger cats") and let their deBroglie waves interfere in a collision, in direct analogy with Young's double-slit experiment.

  description: By studying the emergence of steady-state Fano coherences in three-level quantum V-systems driven by incoherent light, we establish a direct connection between the seemingly unrelated phenomena of incoherent driving of multilevel quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum transport in qubit networks.
