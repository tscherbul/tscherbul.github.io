  image: 2023-Science.png
  description: Mechanisms for violating ergodicity (the ability of a quantum system to thermalize) are of interest for probing nonequilibrium matter and protecting quantum coherence in complex systems. We study rotational ergodicity breaking in an unprecedentedly large fullerene molecule, C60, determined from its icosahedral rovibrational fine structure.

- title: "A Feshbach resonance in collisions between triplet ground-state molecules"
  image: 2023-FR-model.png
  description:  We report a very pronounced and narrow (25 mG) Feshbach resonance in collisions between two triplet ground-state NaLi molecules. Our observations provide strong evidence for the existence of long-lived coherent intermediate complexes even in systems without reaction barriers and open up the possibility of coherent control of chemical reactions.

  description:  We show that it is possible to efficiently control ultracold chemical reactions of NaLi molecules in their metastable triplet states colliding with Na atoms by choosing the internal hyperfine and rovibrational states of the reactants and by inducing magnetic Feshbach resonances with an external magnetic field.

- title: "Complete Quantum Coherent Control of Ultracold Molecular Collisions"
  image: 2021-CC-PRL.png
  description: We show that quantum interference-based coherent control is a highly efficient tool for tuning ultracold molecular collision dynamics. The basic idea of coherent control is to prepare tunable quantum superposition states ("Schrodinger cats") and to let their deBroglie waves interfere in a collision, in direct analogy with Young's double-slit experiment.
