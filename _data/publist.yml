  image: 2020-PRR-LiCaH-resonances.png
  description: We perform the first numerically exact three-dimensional quantum scattering calculations on strongly anisotropic atom-molecule collisions in an external magnetic field, and study how vibrational degrees of freedom affect ultracold collision dynamics and magnetic Feshbach resonances.

- title: "Coherent control of reactive scattering at low temperatures: Signatures of quantum interference in the differential cross sections for F + H2 and F + HD"
  image: 2020-PRA-coherent-control.png
  description: We show that angle-dependent reactive scattering of cold molecules can be efficiently controlled by forming coherent superpositions of degenerate rotational states, an example of quantum interference-based coherent control in action.

  description: Our new theory of electron spin coherence lifetimes of alkali-metal atoms trapped in a solid para-hydrogen matrix agrees well with experimental observations. This is good news for using matrix-isolated atoms to store quantum information.
